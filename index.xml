The shop at Olin has lots of offerings, from mills and lathes to 3D printers and laser cutters, and all of them have a training that you must go through to be authorized to use the tool.
The platform that I built provides students and staff a way to sign up for trainings and keep track of their progress, and would allow the machine shop staff to approve trainees and keep tabs on who is authorized to use which tools.</description></item><item><title>NEATO Gauntlet</title><link>https://www.jackgreenberg.co/projects/neato-gauntlet/index.json</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 20:20:30 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.jackgreenberg.co/projects/neato-gauntlet/index.json</guid><description>The objective of this project (the final of my Olin class Quantitative Engineering Analysis) was to navigate a simulated Roomba-like robot through a world called The Gauntlet, avoiding obstacles (boxes) until finally reaching the goal (cylinder).
The Gauntlet
The Code RANSAC The RANSAC, or Random Sample Consensus algorithm is a method of identifying features from a dataset. It works by selecting a set of points and fitting a model to them.</description></item><item><title>I2C2</title><link>https://www.jackgreenberg.co/projects/i2c2/index.json</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 20:43:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.jackgreenberg.co/projects/i2c2/index.json</guid><description>&lt;p>I wrote an &lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-greenberg/i2c2">implementation of the I2C protocol&lt;/a> (inter-integrated chip) in C.

It provides a helpful diagnostic interface for debugging the shutdown circuit and helps engineers quickly identify sources of failure for the car.
The Shutdown Circuit The shutdown circuit is the primary safety checking circuit of the car, and runs around the entire body of the vehicle. It controls the the AIRs, or accumultors isolation relays, which allow high voltage (~400V nominal) from the accumulator2 to flow to the motor controller.</description></item><item><title>BSPD Brakelight Circuit</title><link>https://www.jackgreenberg.co/projects/bspd/index.json</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 18:20:30 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.jackgreenberg.co/projects/bspd/index.json</guid><description>My first project for Olin Electric Motorsports was redesigning the mission-critical brake system plausibility device. The analog circuit controls one node of the shutdown circuit on the car, helping to ensure the safety of the driver and vehicle.
How to PCB The final deliverable for this project was a PCB, or printed circuit board, which would slot into the car&amp;rsquo;s low voltage box. Along with performing a critical safety check for the electrical systems during racing, the circuit also handles activating the brakelight based on the reading of an brake pressure sensor.</description></item><item><title>A Quick Note</title><link>https://www.jackgreenberg.co/note/index.json</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jackgreenberg.co/note/index.json</guid><description>A few years ago, I learned that there was a man before me by the name Jack Greenberg1, who was a prominent civil rights lawyer. He was the NAACP Legal Defense Fund&amp;rsquo;s second legal director after Thurgood Marshall.
Jack Greenberg, civil rights lawyer.
I proceeded to read more on the LDF&amp;rsquo;s website:
He litigated the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case that overturned the “separate but equal” doctrine.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://www.jackgreenberg.co/about/index.json</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.jackgreenberg.co/about/index.json</guid><description>Hi there! My name is Jack Greenberg I am an engineering student at Olin College of Arts and Crafts Engineering, studying electrical and computer engineering. I am most passionate about firmware/embedded systems and computer networking.
At Olin I am an electrical design lead for our Formula SAE team Olin Electric Motorsports working on a brand-new telemetry system.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also worked at Indico as a software engineer, creating a secure permissioning agent to decrease network traffic between their microservices, and upgraded their whole coroutine infrastructure with no integration issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
